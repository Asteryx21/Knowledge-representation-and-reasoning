# Knowledge-representation-and-reasoning.

Showcase of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuOnzobrXpc <br><br>
Used: Java, NetBeans, JUnit, Protégé, Owl ontologies.<br><br>
Created a custom owl ontology for movies with Protégé.<br>
<br>
I developed an application in Java that uses the ontology I designed, trying to highlight the possibility of extending its information through the Reasoning mechanism.<br>
<br>
The application:<br>
  * Loads my OWL ontology and applies the Inference model. <br>
  * Retrieves and presents individuals of the ontology after the selection of a class by the user.<br>
  * Allows inserting new individuals.<br>
  * Allows to search for individuals based on user-defined parameter values ​​using SPARQL queries.<br>
