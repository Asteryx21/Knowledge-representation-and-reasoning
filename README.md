# Knowledge-representation-and-reasoning.

Showcase of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuOnzobrXpc
USED: Java, NetBeans, JUnit, Protégé, Owl ontologies.
Created a custom owl ontology for movies with Protégé.

I developed an application in Java that uses the ontology I designed, trying to highlight the possibility of extending its information through the Reasoning mechanism.

The application:
*Loads my OWL ontology and applies the Inference model. 
*Retrieves and presents individuals of the ontology after the selection of a class by the user.
*Allows inserting new individuals.
*Allows to search for individuals based on user-defined parameter values ​​using SPARQL queries.
