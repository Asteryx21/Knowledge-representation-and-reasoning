# Knowledge-representation-and-reasoning.

Created a custom owl ontology for movies with Protégé.

I developed an application in Java that uses the ontology I designed, trying to highlight the possibility of extending its information through the Reasoning mechanism.
The application:

Loads my OWL ontology and applies the Inference model. 

Retrieves and presents individuals of the ontology after the selection of a class by the user.

Allows inserting new individuals.

Allows to search for individuals based on user-defined parameter values ​​using SPARQL queries.
